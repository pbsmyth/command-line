If asked to show someone who has never seen a computer how to *do* something on your computer, many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"). Today we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (macOS) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.

In this workshop, you will:

- Learn common commands to create files (`touch` and `echo`)
- Learn commands to create directories (`mkdir`)
- Navigate our file structure using change directory (`cd`), print working directory (`pwd`), and list (`ls`)
- Move content from one place to another using redirects (`>`) and pipes (`|`)
- Explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`
- Search text files using the `grep` command
- Create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn

## Before you get started

If you do not have experience or basic knowledge of the following workshops, you may want to look into those before you start with Introduction to the Command Line:

To complete the workshop, you will need:

- A plain text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) installed
- To know what operating system you're using. If you are on a Mac, you will be using your Terminal. If you're using Windows, you will need to install Git Bash, following [these instructions](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/git.md), so that we can work in the cross-platform Unix command line for this session.

### Ethical Considerations

Before you start the Introduction to the Command Line workshop, we want to remind you of some ethical considerations to take into account when you read through the lessons of this workshop:

- "The command line" is laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming. As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun discusses in ["On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge" (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1162/1526381043320741), almost all computers (as in human computers) in the US during World War II were young women. Human computers received commands from analysts——predominantly men with the military—that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun (p. 34) argues

    > computation depends on 'yes, sir' in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands ... The command line is a mere operating system (OS) simulation.

  If commands are the ways in which a user communicates with machines, the command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.

### Pre-reading suggestions

Before you start the Introduction to the Command Line workshop, you may want to read a couple of our pre-reading suggestions:

- [Neal Stephenson's "In the Beginning... Was the Command Line"](http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html) is a useful piece to grasp the relationship between (and the affordances of) the command line and the GUI.
- [Douglas Rushkoff's *Program or Be Programmed*](https://rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/) offers some reflections on how using the command line allows one to communicate in a less mediated way with their machines and the importance of doing so in the current technoscape.

### Projects that use these skills

You may also want to check out a couple of projects that use the skills discussed in this workshop:

Mastering the command line will prove useful in a great number of projects.

- Most Python- and R-based projects will require you to have some knowledge of the command line. At a very basic level, you will be invoking a Python script and will be using values of command line arguments when creating and running your scripts.
- The command line is also useful for setting up installations of server side software like [Omeka](www.omeka.org). The command line will allow you to navigate the file structure of your server. Commands like ls, mkdir, rmdir, cd, etc. are really important. For example, grep could help you find a plugin directory that you might have accidentally placed in the wrong location.
- A recent digital capstone project by Christofer Gass runs a Python script on the [command line](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/3786/)
- [Awesome Bash](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash), "a curated list of delightful Bash scripts and resources."
